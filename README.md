# -Rainfall-Prediction-Classifier
Rainfall Prediction Classifier
This project focuses on predicting whether it will rain the next day using machine learning classification models. It uses historical weather data and applies preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification algorithms to predict rainfall occurrence.

📌 Project Objectives
Predict whether it will rain tomorrow (RainTomorrow) based on weather data collected today.

Apply machine learning models and evaluate their performance.

Visualize important patterns and correlations in the data.
